Typing Speed Game

Project Description
This is a typing speed game developed using Python and the `turtle` graphics library. The game challenges the player to type falling letters before they reach the bottom of the screen. 
The player earns points for each correct letter typed and loses points for incorrect ones. The game increases in difficulty as the player progresses through levels, with faster falling letters and more frequent letter drops.

Features
- Dynamic Difficulty: The game gets progressively harder with each level. The speed of falling letters increases, and the drop rate is adjusted after every award milestone.
- Score and Level Tracking: The score and level are displayed on the screen.
- Awards System: The player earns awards at specific milestones (50, 100, 200 points), unlocking faster gameplay.
- Keyboard Interaction: The player types the falling letters to score points.

Game Controls
- Keyboard Input: Press the corresponding key on your keyboard to type the falling letters.
- Awards: Reach specific scores to earn special titles and increase the gameâ€™s difficulty.
  - 50 points: "Fast Typist"
  - 100 points: "Typing Master"
  - 200 points: "Typing Legend"
